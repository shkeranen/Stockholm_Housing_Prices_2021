# Stockholm_House_Prices_2021

Plotting Stockholm housing prices per sqm to map by using R. 

Idea for this mini project came when we were browsing over Stockholm housing markets (Warning: crazy prices!).

This project is done by R.

- Geo location data of Sweden is retrieved.
- Stockholm housing prices are retrieved from year 2021 and plotted to the map to show the differences between municipalities average house prices.
- The data plotted to the maps is average price per sqm and it is recorded in the local currency (Swedish Krona). 

From the map we can see that the immediate city center is the most expensive and prices start to drop when leaving the center.

A fun saturday project which allows practising R and ggplot!

For future work, it would be handy to cut the amount of labels for readability
Interval can be changed to enchance the readability
Naming and other visual components should be added
